# Airline On-Time Performance & Weather Forecast

Severe weather is usually very disruptive to both airline operations and consumer plans. It can either cause delays or
cancellations or sometimes both which leads to a very unhappy passenger and frustrated airline employees. In this project
we will analyze implications of weather forecast on on-time performance of airline carriers and attempt to predict the
probability of a flight getting delayed of cancelled for a given set of weather forecast parameters.
